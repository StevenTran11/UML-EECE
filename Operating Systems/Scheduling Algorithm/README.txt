Project 3

To run program type:
./main testin#.dat outfile.txt interval#

testin#.dat # can be any number.  Make sure it is in the same folder as main.c
outfile.txt will be made if it does not exist in the folder already.
interval is time interval#

This code does not check if file is formatted correctly. It will crash not run properly if input file is not in format: burst priority arrival time
