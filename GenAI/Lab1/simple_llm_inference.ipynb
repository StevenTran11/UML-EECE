    "**A Glimpse Into Text Generation with Language Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're intrigued by how machines can generate human-like text, let's take a closer look at the underlying code. Even if you're not technically inclined, this section will provide a high-level understanding of how it all works.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Definition**: The `ChatBotModel` class is the core of our text generation. It handles the setup, optimization, and interaction with the LLM (Large Language Model).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: When you create an instance of this class, you can specify the model's path, the device to run on (defaulting to Intel's \"xpu\" device if available), and the data type. There's also an option to optimize the model for Intel GPUs using Intel Extension For PyTorch (IPEX).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Preparation**: The `prepare_input` method ensures that the input doesn't exceed the maximum length and combines the previous text with the user input, if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Generation**: The `gen_output` method takes the prepared input and several parameters controlling the generation process, like temperature, top_p, top_k, etc., and produces the text response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Warm-up**: Before the main interactions, the `warmup_model` method helps in \"warming up\" the model to make subsequent runs faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Processing**: Several methods like `unique_sentences`, `remove_repetitions`, and `extract_bot_response` handle the text processing to ensure the generated text is readable and free from repetitions or unnecessary echoes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to explore the code and play around with different parameters. Remember, this is a simple and interactive way to experiment with text generation. It's not a cutting-edge chatbot, but rather a playful tool to engage with language models. Enjoy the journey into the world of LLMs, using Intel® Data Center GPU Max 1100s!\n"

    "\n",
    "In the next section, we'll create an interactive text generation interface right here in this notebook. This will enable you to select a model, provide a prompt, and tweak various parameters without touching the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Choose from available pre-trained models or enter a custom model from the HuggingFace Hub.\n",
    "- **Interaction Mode**: Decide whether to interact with or without context, allowing the model to remember previous interactions or treat each input independently.\n",
    "- **Temperature**: Adjust this parameter to control the randomness in text generation. Higher values increase creativity; lower values make the generation more deterministic.\n",
    "- **Top_p, Top_k**: Play with these parameters to influence the diversity and quality of the generated text.\n",
    "- **Number of Beams**: Control the breadth of the search in text generation.\n",
    "- **Repetition Penalty**: Modify this to prevent or allow repeated phrases and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've set your preferences, you can start the interaction and even reset or reload the model to try different settings. Let's set this up and explore the playful world of text generation using Intel® Data Center GPU Max 1100s!\n",
